  "content": "<p>The <strong>Strauss-Howe Generational Theory</strong> is a historical framework introduced by historians <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Strauss\">William Strauss</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Howe\">Neil Howe</a>. The theory posits that history moves in cycles, known as \"turnings,\" which span roughly 80 to 100 years. Each cycle is divided into four distinct turnings: the <em>High</em>, the <em>Awakening</em>, the <em>Unraveling</em>, and the <em>Crisis</em>. These stages represent recurring archetypes of societal attitudes, generational behaviors, and historical events.</p><p>The four turnings function like seasons within a human lifetime, where each generation plays a specific role. For example, the \"High\" phase often follows a major crisis, featuring strong institutions and collective optimism. In contrast, the \"Crisis\" phase is marked by upheaval and transformation. This cyclical nature suggests that society experiences repeated patterns of growth, stability, decline, and renewal. Notable examples of crises include the American Revolution, the Civil War, and World War II.</p><p>Strauss and Howe's generational archetypes - <strong>Prophets, Nomads, Heroes, and Artists</strong> - are defined by their collective experiences during each turning. Their theory has gained attention in fields ranging from sociology to political analysis, offering insights into generational conflicts and future trends.
